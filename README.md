# Anamoly-Detector
PyCaretâ€™s Anomaly Detection Module is an unsupervised machine learning module that is used for identifying rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Typically, the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors . This module provide several pre-processing features that prepares the data for modeling through setup function. This module has over 12 ready-to-use algorithms and several plots to analyze the results of trained models
